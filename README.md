The proposal is for a collective game project whose main driving idea is to be developed by anyone, have little to no direction, accept as many contributions as possible (all that are not disruptive) and go with the result in an ever increasing mess of a game, a glorification of chaos.

Programming will begin soon, and for best results as a codebase is created here I expect everyone to contribute criticism. Also, this is time for architecture discussions.
