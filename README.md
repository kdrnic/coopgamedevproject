The proposal is for a collective game project whose main driving idea is to be developed by anyone, have little to no direction, accept as many contributions as possible (all that are not disruptive) and go with the result in an ever increasing mess of a game, a glorification of chaos.

### HOW TO JOIN
* Please read the wiki
* Watch the repository on github so you are notified of news
* Join #ludumdare @ irc.afternet.org and tell drnick what you think of the project
* Answer surveys (linked above)
* Use Issues or Wiki to discuss ideas for the project
* We can also maintain our own IRC channel later
* I'd love the project to be happening by mid September or sooner (and yes this is completely arbitrary)
